# Data folder

Before running `../do_all.R`, place the SCF summary files for all the survey waves you would like in this folder.

The summary files can be downloaded from [the SCF's website](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm). For each wave, navigate to "**Summary Extract Public Data**" and download the **Stata Extract Data** (you won't need Stata). Extract the contents of the compressed file and place the file with name `rscfp[YEAR].dta` here. Repeat this step for every survey wave.
